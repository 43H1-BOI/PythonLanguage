# 11. Write a python program to demonstrate all operators â€“ 
#       a) Arithmetic Operators 
#       b) Assignment Operators 
#       c) Comparison Operators 
#       d) Logical Operators 
#       e) Bitwise Operators 
#       f) Special Operators


# 11.a) Arithmetic Operators 
sum = 5 + 6
sub = 5 - 6
mul = 5 * 6
div = 5 / 6
mod = 5 % 6

# Don't Write Print Statements
print("5 + 6 =",sum)
print("5 - 6 =",sub)
print("5 * 6 =",mul)
print("5 / 6 =",div)
print("5 % 6 =",mod)


# 11.b) Assignment Operators 

a = 5 # Assignment
b = 4

a += 3      # a = a + 3
a -= 3.3    # a = a - 3.3
b *= 2      # a = a * 2
a /= 5      # a = a / 5
a %= 7      # a = a % 7


# 11.c) Comparison Operators

c = a > b  # less than
d = a <= b # greater than or equals
e = a == b # equals
f = a != b # not equals

# These Will Return True and False
print(c,d,e,f)
